Here is a landing page to showcase my work that I am currently at liberty to distribute. Upon submission to conferences or journals with double-blind reviews, I will have to temporarily delete these papers.

"Specialized Neural Network Pruning for Boolean Abstractions" is published in KEOD.
We are targeting conferences for "Parallel Time Networks" and "Multi-Objective Synthetic Data to Reduce Sample Selection Bias in Clinical Data".
Please see [https://github.com/jarrenbr/SIAM24NeuralArchitectures](https://github.com/jarrenbr/SIAM24NeuralArchitectures) for "Advanced Techniques for Imputing, Forecasting, and Synthesizing Multivariate Meteorlogical Data", under review for SIAM 2024.
For my master's thesis, please see [https://github.com/jarrenbr/ThesisPublic](https://github.com/jarrenbr/ThesisPublic).
